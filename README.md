# homeassistant-huepower
Custom component to calculate power consumption of hue lights.
This component uses CSV files to lookup power consumption based on brightness, hue/saturation and color temperature. 

## Installation

Copy `custom_components/huepower` into your Home Assistant `config` directory.

HACS support is coming soon.

## Configuration

Add the following to your configuration.yaml:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: huepower
    entity_id: light.livingroom_floorlamp
  - platform: huepower
    entity_id: light.livingroom_ceiling
```

The `entity_id` must be a light entity provided by the `Philips Hue` integration

The model id will be automatically detected by looking at the Hue Bridge API data.
Alternatively you can force a given model:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: huepower
    entity_id: light.livingroom_floorlamp
    model: LCT010
```

## CSV data files

To calculate power consumtion a lookup is done into CSV data files.

These files are located in `custom_components/huepower/data` directory.
Each light model has it's own subdirectory `{manufactuer}/{modelid}`
Depending on the supported color modes the integration expects multiple CSV files here:
 - hs.csv (hue/saturation, colored lamps)
 - color_temp.csv (color temperature)

Some lights support both color modes, so there will be two CSV files.

Example:

```
- signify
  - LCT010
    - hs.csv
    - color_temp.csv
```

### Expected file structure

hs.csv:

```
brightness, hue, saturation, watt
```

color_temp.csv

```
brightness, mired, watt
```

### Support for new light

New files are created by taking measurements using a smartplug (i.e. Shelly plug) and changing the light to all kind of different variations using the Hue API.
An example script is available `utils/measure/measure.py`.

## Supported models
- Signify LCT010 (hs and color_temp)
- Signify LCT012 (hs and color_temp). Thanks Simon HÃ¶rrle
- Signify LTW001 (color_temp)

## Debug loggin

Add the following to configuration.yaml:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.huepower: debug
```
